# Sudoku Solver Contest
A friendly contest for people in the AIMA reading group. Try not to cheat as the goal is to explore and learn different strategies to solve constraint satisfaction problems. 

Typical input files have multiple puzzles, each on a separate line like so:  
`4.....8.5.3..........7......2.....6.....8.4......1.......6.3.7.5..2.....1.4......`  
This particular line represents the puzzle below:  
```
4 . . |. . . |8 . 5 
. 3 . |. . . |. . . 
. . . |7 . . |. . . 
------+------+------
. 2 . |. . . |. 6 . 
. . . |. 8 . |4 . . 
. . . |. 1 . |. . . 
------+------+------
. . . |6 . 3 |. 7 . 
5 . . |2 . . |. . . 
1 . 4 |. . . |. . . 
```
The output file from your solver should have the same format, except that all blank spaces should be filled (no `.`s).
You should implement your solver in the file provided with your name.

## Rules
1. We constrain the programming language to be Python for fairness and convenience. 
2. External libraries are allowed, but try not to go too crazy and give notice beforehand. 
3. We will check results on **July 1st**, and finish by **August 12th** (when we start part 3 of the book).
4. (may add more)
